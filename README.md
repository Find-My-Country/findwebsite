# FIND YOUR COUNTRY 
## 🌍 "Find Your Country" - Interactive Country Explorer
"Find Your Country" is an interactive, visually appealing country explorer that allows users to search for countries and view important details such as flag, population, languages, currency, and capital. The website will fetch real-time country data using the REST Countries API and present it in an engaging way. Additionally, the project includes a fun “Guess the Country” challenge, where users see a random flag and must guess the correct country name before revealing the answer.
